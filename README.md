# MARKSHEET WITH AUTO GRADING AND SUM CALCULATION
My mom asked me to calculate sums and fill up subjectwise grades in her students' marksheet. Good lord! Adding numbers in ~100 marksheets using calculator, noting the grades was too much annoying and takes quite some time, especially since I'm busy and tired. And you have to retotal those 100 marksheets again.... Just too much for me.

So, I wrote down this simple page to help her. You just enter the subjectwise numbers and it automatically inserts the grade and calculates the sum for you. Nothing special here, but might be handy for someone else too. Just make sure you edit out the grade comparision formula according to your needs. Some jquery and its done. I didn't even bother writing the usual 

```sh
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!--and so on and so on-->
```
tags. So nothing fancy.
